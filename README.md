# Pay & Go

<h2>What is Pay & Go</h2>
The project Pay & Go is a case study and my graduation project.

Basicly it helps people when they go out. People can place an order with their mobile phones, and pay the check with credit card through the application.

It works on Windows 10 Mobile.

<h2>Pay & Go enables you to go dutch</h2>
Pay  & Go also offers splitting the check. For each person on the table, different sessions starts.

With the aid of different sessions, it is possible to pay the check separately. Pay & Go is the best way to go dutch.
